<!--
- I will be focusing my efforts towards improving my proficency with Python üêç. Skills I am actively trying to enhance:
  - software design (writing cleaner code)
  - Pandas (data importing, cleaning, exploration)
  - automation (small programs to automate menial tasks at work)
-->
 
<!--My next area of growth will be focused on honing my ability to explore the data at my company, coming up with questions about the data, and answering those questions with visualizations. I will be primarily using Python, but I also want to start familiaring myself more with Tableau. <br> -->
