# 💬 About Me:
Hi! My name is Jason. I am an analyst and have worked in the healthcare industry for over five years.<br>
<br>Self-learning is a passion of mine, so paired with my interest in data analytics, I will be working to improve my skills as an analyst to derive more value in my career as well as value in my life outside of work.<br>
<br>I am currently focused on improving my Python skills, with my two month goal being to find a way to integrate Python into my day-to-day responsibilities in a meaningful way. (November 1, 2022)<br>
<br>Thanks for visiting, and I hope you have a great day!<br>
